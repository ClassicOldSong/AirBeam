- [Artemis](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android) - Android client for Apollo  
- [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui) - A high-performance frontend framework based on signals  
- [Methanol](https://github.com/SudoMaker/methanol) - An ultra-high-performance static site generator based on rEFui and MDX. It’s really very fast and highly customizable.
